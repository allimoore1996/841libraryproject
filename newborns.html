			<p> One of the most important parts of having a newborn is figuring out that sleep schedule! As new parents, we found that a few things helped insure sleep was available for both us and the baby. </p>
				<p> First, we have to be realistic, your newborn is going to need fed every 2-4 hours no matter what. So don't go into this thinking you're going to get 8 hours of sleep a night. The biggest advice that I can give is sleep when the baby sleeps. This sounds so simple, but you are going to want to try to clean the house, do laundry, and all kinds of "chores" when that beautiful baby is sleeping. <b> DON'T</b>! During these first few months just let go of the reigns a little, let your partner pick up the slack, and get your rest when the baby is resting. </p>
				<p>Next, restrict visitors those first couple of weeks. I know people will want to come and visit but you and your newborn need some rest. Restricting to just those you WANT to come over will reduce your stress. Extra hint, make your husband be the bad guy and tell them!<p>
